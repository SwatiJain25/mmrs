                        <p>When we perceive someone's behavior negatively, we often jump to conclusions and make
                            assumptions about why someone acted the way they did. When giving feedback to that person,
                            it can be hard to stay objective. Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI™) is a tool developed by
                            the Center for Creative Leadership that helps you remove judgement out of the feedback you
                            give and make it clearer.</p>
                        <p>This tool works best for giving negative feedback as it can make the recipient less defensive
                            about it, but it can absolutely be used for positive feedback, too.</p>
                        <h3>How it works</h3>
                        <p>SBI™ offers a simple few steps along which you can structure the feedback you want to give.
                        </p>
                        <h4>1. Situation</h4>
                        <p>Start with the situation where the behavior occurred. This helps with making the feedback
                            specific and the other person can more easily relate to it.</p>
                        <h4>2. Behavior</h4>
                        <p>Describe the specific behavior you're giving feedback about. Tell the other person what
                            they've done or what you've seen, not your interpretation of it. This is critical to leave
                            your judgement out of the feedback.</p>
                        <h4>3. Impact</h4>
                        <p>Explain what kind of impact their behavior had. This can range from what you thought and felt
                            and why, to broader impact on others or the whole team.</p>
                        <h4>Plus: Intent</h4>
                        <p>Sometimes, you may want to ask what the intention was behind their behavior. They might have
                            a sound reason that you don't know about or is different from your assumptions.</p>
                        <p>This can greatly help explain the gap between their intent and the actual impact.</p>
                        <h4>Encourage reflection</h4>
                        <p>Feedback is only useful when it's considered and acted upon. Encourage the other person to
                            reflect on what you've said and think how they might act differently in the future.</p>
                        <p>If you asked about their intent, it can be a good starting point for discussing what to
                            change.</p>
                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <p>Let's see what giving feedback using this tool can look like. Imagine a manager talking to
                            their report after a recent meeting.</p>
                        <p>They start with the situation: "<em>In yesterday's product review meeting, when you were
                                giving an update for your team...</em>"</p>
                        <p>Then they describe their report's behavior: "<em>...you didn't share any recent learnings
                                about how our customers use this new feature...</em>"</p>
                        <p>And share the impact the behavior had: "<em>...which made me worry if you've been talking to
                                our customers recently at all.</em>"</p>
                        <p>Finally, they ask about their intent: "<em>Why didn't you share anything this time?</em>"</p>
                        <p>This can continue with the discussion about the gap between the intent and the impact.</p>
                        <h3>Takeaway</h3>
                        <p>Use the SBI™ tool to give clearer feedback in a non-judgemental way. Frame the feedback
                            within a situation, describe the specific behavior and share the impact the behavior had.
                            You can also follow-up by asking about the intent to start a healthy and objective
                            discussion.</p>
